### Setup

- Hackers arrived much earlier than planned
  - Hard to balance between setup and greeting hackers

### Hackers Start Arriving

- "Warm" greeting was not clearly communicated
  - Be personable (be a host)
    - "If you need any help, let me know!"
    - "Can I get you water?"
- Not enough laptops
  - Difficult to have people start without laptop

### Start

- Started at 12:20pm
  - People still trickled in after
- Next session will need a greeter at the door and a host in the hacker space

### Context & Setup

- Instead of "How are you doing?" say "I liked x part of y. What are working on right now? "
- Replace Slack with tlk.io/hackseries

## Next session
