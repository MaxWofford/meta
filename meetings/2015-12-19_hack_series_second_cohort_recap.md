### Setup

- Hackers arrived much earlier than planned
  - Hard to balance between setup and greeting hackers

- "Warm" greeting was not clearly communicated
  - Be personable (be a host)
    - "If you need any help, please just ask"
    - "Can I get you water?"
- Not enough laptops
  - Difficult to have people start without laptop

### Start

- Started at 12:20pm
  - People still trickled in after
- Next session will need a greeter at the door and a host in the hacker space
