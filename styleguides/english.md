This is an English style guide that Hack Club workshops should follow to stay
consistent in how we refer to common things.

## Terminology and Capitalization

### General Guides

**Company names** Company names are proper nouns and should be capitalized
according to how the company capitalizes it's name.

### List of Terminology

**club leader** Not _Hack Club leader_ or _club director_.

**console** Not _command line_, _command prompt_, or _terminal_.

**double-click** Not _double click_.

**filename**

**Hack Club**

**hacker**

**OK** Don't use _Okay_ or _Ok_.

**pop-up** Don't use _popup_ or _pop up_.

**right-click**

**styleguide** Not _style guide_ or _Style Guide_

**URL**

## Punctuation

**Sentences End With Punctuation**

All sentences should end with punctuation, even if they end with inline-code, a
URL, or a filename.

_Example:_

_Correct: Go to https://google.com._

_Correct: Make sure the CSS selector is set to `#username`._

_Correct: Your website is now live at `example.com`!_

_Incorrect: This will save to `index.html`_

**Serial (Oxford) Commas**

For simplicity, the final comma in a list of elements (usually the one before
the 'and' or 'or') is left in the list.

_Example:_

_Correct: Make sure to include the HTML, CSS, and JS files._

_Correct: This guide details standards for developing flexible, durable, and
sustainable HTML and CSS._

**Acronyms should be in capitals**

All letters in an acronym should be in capital letters, unless they are usually
capitalized in another way.

_Example:_

_Correct: HTML_

_Correct: API_

_Correct: iOS_

## Other Style Guidelines

**Locale**

Workshops should use American English, as it is the default for most programming
related topics.

**bold**

Keywords should be **bold**.

_Example:_

```
This workshop explains how to use **HTML** & **CSS**.
```

**inline code**

Use the inline code style for any names directly used in code. _Don't_ use it
for emphasizing regular English or programming related words not used in code.

_Example:_

_Correct:_ Create a new `<script>` tag.

_Incorrect:_ Run git push in the terminal to push our changes to GitHub.

_Incorrect:_ Each of the interactive elements on the page are called `sprites`.
